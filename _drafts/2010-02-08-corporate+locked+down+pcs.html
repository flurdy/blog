http://www.slate.com/id/2226279/pagenum/all/<br /><br />having worked in IT admin/support of a large multinational (thankfully biefly) I certainly understand the urge to restrict possible damage by users.<br /><br />and seen sales/managers with little knowledge or "too busy" to consider security etc when they install everything they can click on..<br /><br />but for the average knoweldge engineer etc, <br /><br />having a restrictive network, the the age of research by google is a big handicap<br /><br />having non local admin/sudo on you own pc to run the software you need is not just a big handicap it is counter productive.<br /><br />which leads to morale loss etc.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
