## Ban What-Ifs in meetings

Many meetings drags on discussing what-if scenarios, don't waste time on those.


## What is "What If"?

We have all been to meetings that gathers the whole team and more in and the majority of the time is spent on what could possible happen and to plan the response to those in detail. And further what-ifs beyond that. With responses planned in detail. It is a huge waste of time as most will never happen.


### Not business wide what-ifs

The necessity or futility of corporation wide business scenario meetings are not the focus of this blog post.

This post is more about the smaller frequent team/project/department meetings what-ifs.


## Drags on

### Meetings that drag on forever is my main moan

Many meetings are a quick team huddle to discuss a particular task/issue. Often a plan to handle this issue is quickly brainstormed and agreed on.

But... then most meetings do not end there.

As mentioned at the top people start to discuss and plan what if the first solution does not work. And more iterations and decision trees beyond that for the second, third, etc solution. These becomes so speculative and of little value as usually situations change too much for them to carry much value.


### Using allocated meeting time

These meetings that drag on I despise. Just trying to fill the time allocated instead of letting people leave to crack on.
I used to love arguing these possible technicalities for the sake of it, but these days I just see the wasted effort.

__If a meeting can finish after 10 minutes then great.__ Those are good meetings.


### Selfish

Quite frequently this can be due to the meeting organiser having a busy schedule, but often the rest of the attendees do not.
Don't waste their time due to your inability to decline meetings.


### Depressing

Not just the wasted time is upsetting, but planning for a future that do not happen can affect moral. People may start to look forward to something they have discussed in detail only to realise later on that it will never happen. And over and over again.

And sometimes the discussions themselves can turn out not to be team building but have the opposite affect if the discussions become confrontational or someone always trumps their preference etc.


## Meetings are expensive

Meetings themselves are expensive. The more the larger the crowd. People have basically downed tools during the meeting. And interrupts teams, pairs, individuals productivity a lot. So affects for longer than just the meeting allocation.

Analyses preparation before, estimation, documentation afterwards, etc are further expense on top of these meeting costs.


#### Anecdote

I still remember 15 years ago when I was working for a consultancy where most of the department was body-shopped to clients on-site as individual contractors.
Sometimes however everyone was called into the HQ office for some basic info and "team" bonding. In one of these meetings everyone was in a large meeting room.

The CEO, or maybe it was the CFO, popped his head through the door. His eyes grew wide, nearly watering, as he saw 30 of his contractors that was not at the clients invoicing. He gasped: *"Wow this is an expensive meeting!"*


## Plans Are Worthless, But Planning Is Everything

*Misquote from Dwight D. Eisenhower*

### Is planning not essential?

#### Being unprepared is na&#239;ve and irresponsible

<!-- Planning by using long meetings with everyone is -->

<!-- But planning in detail from macro business level to micro team levels for all eventualities are unnecessary.
Especially if done by everyone in big long meetings. -->

Do have some plans for the most likely scenarios.

And preparedness for catastrophic events.


### Groom a little, but less than you think

<!-- Sure, have some overall plans for the near future, but not all in detail. -->

But not for everything and not in exhaustive detail.

And definitely not from long team wide meetings.

There is no need to have a massive detailed list of features, stories, tasks in some sort of never ending backlog.

Your architects, analyst, UX researchers, project and product owners, etc will naturally have to have some foresight into the funnel coming up.
That is in their job description, but no need to involve everyone in all of these when they are speculative.


## Focus, iteratively

### The next step, only

First just try the agreed initial next step. Properly. Only.

And only afterwards look into detail on the following what-ifs once you know the outcome of the first step.

And then only plan and focus for the new next step.


### JITP - Just-in-time-plans

Only have planning meetings for eventualities that will definitely happen. Today. -ish.

I an not a civil engineer, that may need to plan ahead in detail as physical construction issues can be expensive to undo.

But I am a software engineer. We can have meetings and plan __just enough__, act on it, evaluate, then plan just enough again. Iteratively. i.e. "Agile/Lean".


## Meetings are *"cheap"*

Not the time as explained above if large long meetings, but organising quick short meetings with just the people concerned should be easy, and if brief cheap.

These days a quick ad-hoc Zoom meeting or Slack huddle is so effortless.


### No estimations

A lot would benefit from the [no-estimates](https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/the-noestimates-movement/) convention.
You would then have no need to plan future work in detail to have a guestimate.

A lot of time and frustration would be spared.


## Impatient. Less theatre

Maybe a lot of these issues is due to that I seem to get more impatient as I get older, not less. With having kids and a lot more experience you would have thought I would be more mellow and understanding.

But I am not.

I really can not stand all the unnecessary theatre that happens all the time. I have no desire to waste any energy on that.

Go JITP! Boo What-if!
