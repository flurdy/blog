## What is mob programming?

Mob programming is simple: the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, on the same computer.

One person types (the "driver"), while everyone else navigates - discussing, suggesting, reviewing in real-time. The driver role rotates regularly.

It sounds inefficient. Five people doing one person's work? But something counterintuitive happens: you go faster, not slower.

- Decisions happen immediately instead of waiting for reviews
- Knowledge spreads across the team naturally
- Bugs get caught as they're written
- No merge conflicts, no integration problems

### Not meetings, not chaos

Mob programming is not a meeting. You're producing code the whole time. It's also not chaos - there's structure, rotation, and focus.

Think of it as continuous code review with immediate implementation.


## The solo AI trap

AI coding assistants are transforming how we work. But here's what often happens:

Each developer on your team works alone with their AI. They each:
- Interpret requirements differently
- Make different architectural choices
- Build overlapping or conflicting solutions
- Create code the others don't understand

You end up with multiple teams inside one team. Five developers, five directions, five interpretations. The AI amplifies individual productivity - and individual divergence.

> Solo developers with AI agents are highly productive. But productive at what?

Code gets written fast. Integration takes forever. Debugging someone else's AI-generated code is painful. The team fragments.


## The mob + AI sweet spot

Here's the insight: AI agents don't replace mob programming - they supercharge it.

A small mob (4-5 people) working together with AI agents:

- **Shared context** - Everyone sees the same prompts, specs, and AI responses
- **Collective prompt refinement** - Four minds crafting better prompts than one
- **Parallel execution** - Run multiple agents on different tasks, all aligned
- **Real-time review** - AI output gets immediate human scrutiny from multiple perspectives

The mob provides what AI lacks: judgment, context, and coherence.


## Why smaller mobs work better with AI

Traditional mob programming sometimes used larger teams (8-9 people). With AI, smaller works better:

### More active participation

With 4-5 people, everyone stays engaged. No one becomes a passive observer. Each person can meaningfully contribute to prompt crafting and output review.

### Parallel agent orchestration

A small mob can effectively coordinate 2-3 AI agents working simultaneously:
- One agent implementing a feature
- Another writing tests
- A third updating documentation

More people doesn't help here - you need coordination, not headcount.

### Faster rotation

Smaller groups rotate the driver role more frequently. Everyone stays sharp and engaged.


## How it works in practice

### Shared specifications

The mob starts by agreeing on specs and acceptance criteria together. This alignment - which solo developers skip - means AI agents receive consistent, well-thought-out prompts.

### Collaborative prompting

One person drives, but everyone contributes to the prompt. "What if we ask it to..." becomes a team activity. The resulting prompts are clearer and more complete.

### Parallel execution with oversight

The team can run multiple agents on related tasks. Because everyone has shared context, anyone can review any agent's output. No knowledge silos.

### Immediate course correction

When an AI goes in the wrong direction, the mob catches it immediately. No wasted hours following a bad path alone.


## The fragmentation problem

When developers work solo with AI, you get:

- **Architectural drift** - Each person's AI makes different structural choices
- **Style inconsistency** - Code looks like it was written by different teams (because it was)
- **Knowledge silos** - Only one person understands each piece
- **Integration nightmares** - Merging divergent AI-assisted work is painful

A mob stays aligned by definition. There's one codebase direction, one architectural vision, one understanding.


## Remote mob programming

You don't need a physical room. Remote mob programming works surprisingly well:

- Screen sharing (driver shares their screen)
- Video call for discussion
- Shared documentation for specs and context
- Rotation timer to keep things moving

In some ways, remote is better - everyone has the same view, recordings are easy, and introverts often participate more freely.


## Getting started

If you haven't tried mob programming:

1. **Start small** - One afternoon, one feature, 3-4 people
2. **Set a rotation timer** - 10-15 minutes per driver
3. **Pick something meaty** - A real feature, not a trivial task
4. **Include the AI** - Have your coding assistant open and visible to all

The first session will feel awkward. That's normal. By the third session, you'll find your rhythm.

### What you'll notice

- Fewer "how does this work?" questions later
- Less time in code review (it already happened)
- More consistent code style
- Better prompt engineering as a team skill


## The ideal team

<!--
TODO: Flesh out this section - the thesis that this is the ideal productive setting
-->

I believe small mob teams with shared AI collaboration represent the most productive team structure we've found yet.

Not individuals racing ahead with their own AI agents. Not large teams with coordination overhead. But 4-5 people, thinking together, prompting together, building together.

The AI handles the typing speed. The mob handles the thinking speed.


## Try it

If your team uses AI assistants, try mobbing for a week. You might find that working together - truly together - is faster than working apart.

> One team, many agents, shared understanding
