I have finally updated my <a href="http://flurdy.com/docs/postfix/">Postfix howto</a>!<br />It is now based on Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron. And as before includes detailed, easy to follow instructions of building a mail server using Postfix, Courier, MySQL, amavisd, SpamAssassin, ClamAV, SASL, TLS and SquirrelMail.<br /><br />It is not quite finished yet however, but I would recommend following it rather than the old one. But keep referencing <a href="http://flurdy.com/docs/postfix/edition5.html">the old one</a> as it has a lot of detail. The new howto, <a href="http://flurdy.com/docs/postfix/edition7.html">edition 7</a>, does at the moment only include the core packages, but enough to get a advanced and secure server up. For any extensions and further info it still referes to the old edition (5). But I will keep padding it out with old and new content.<br /><br />New for this edition is the inclusion of <a href="http://ec2.amazonaws.com">Amazon Elastic Computing Cloud(EC2)</a> as reference build of the server. I have also made public AMIs for people to launch and customize if they so choose.<br /><br />Hope it is of use to people!<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Ivar Abrahamsen
