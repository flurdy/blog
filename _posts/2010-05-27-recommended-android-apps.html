This is a list of Android apps I use and/or recommend. As Android Market is quite a user unfriendly especially when it comes to actually find apps, distinguish quality from copycat rubbish, regional relevance etc so I hope it is of use to some people looking for tips or reviews. <br /><br />All these apps are free as I live in Norway, and Google Market does not allow paid apps in Scandinavia or most of the world. Great policy.... :(<br /><br /><br /><ol><li><b>Touiteur</b>. My prefered Twitter client</li><br /><li><b><s>Locale</s></b> Useful tool that changes settings on your phone depending on different conditions. I use it to lower my ringtone at work, change autolock to off at home, turn of volume during the night, switch on wifi at home, reduce brightness in evening. <br />Note: Locale is no longer free so no longer recommended</li><br /><li><b><s>Wave Secure</s></b> Security app that can remotely locate you lost/stolen phone and do various things such as play a ringtone to locate it, backup data or even wipe / disable the handset. <br />I no longer use it as it is trialware and was worried about battery consumption.</li><br /><li><b>Remember the Milk</b> I just would not function without my rmilk controlling my life</li><br /><li><b>Dolphin</b> A browser. Quite useful. Not 100% switched to it from the stock one, but give it a try.</li><br /><li><b>Spotify</b> Music streaming. Can't live without it.</li><br /><li><b>PlayNow</b> by SonyEricsson.  Music, games and app store by Sony. Quite a good selection of music. Included with my X10</li><br /><li><b>MediaScape</b> by SonyEricsson. Media Photos/Music/Videos organiser and viewer. Works very well. Included with my X10</li><br /><li><b>TimeScape</b> by SonyEricsson.  Social and communication tool.  Neat, but some scaling issue with social tools (Twitter/Facebook). Included with my X10</li><br /><li><b>1881 Mobils√∏k</b> who is calling lookup tool in Norway. Works with all numbers so far.</li><br /><li><b>Listen</b> by Google. My Podcast listener. Use it all the time for my JavaPosse addiction</li><br /><li><b>Places</b> by Google. Very usefull lookup of local info eg resturants etc.</li><br /><li><b>SayMyName</b> text-to-speach announcer of who is calling.
