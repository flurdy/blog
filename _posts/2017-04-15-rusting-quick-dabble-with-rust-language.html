<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">I have spent a few spare moments in the last week looking at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)">Rust</a>, a relative new language.<br /><br />With the kids on Easter break and naturally requiring frequent attention, and a few brief actual paid client work, I have not had as long uninterrupted time <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">focused</span> on Rust as I would have liked. But I have managed to knock together some basic code.</span><br /><br /><br /><h4><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Rustic Pizza</span></h4><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">I created <a href="http://github.com/flurdy/rustic-pizza">github.com/flurdy/rustic-pizza</a> as my playground with rust and various web frameworks. It is very basic code and I expect I will be quite embarrassed by it in just a few months but it is a start. Rustic pizza <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">will eventually contain</span> several very basic web applications each in a different Rust web frameworks, all for ordering pizza. The pizzeria is a concept that I have created many times over in Java and Scala as an example for piece of framework or similar, some of which I have documented on my <a href="http://flurdy.com/">flurdy.com</a> website.</span><br /><br /><br /><h4><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Experience so far</span></h4><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">So far I have found Rust interesting.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">It perhaps use a bit too much of lazy abbreviated names for its keywords, primitives and core methods than I feel is reasonable, but that is me being pedantic. The ownership transfers, lifetimes and everything by reference is a bit of headfuck, but I think I got the hang of it. Rust does also have some of the monadic traits I am comfortable with from the Scala world, though its <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">F</span>utures seems to be somewhat in its infancy at the moment.</span><br /><br /><br /><h4><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Install Rust</span></h4><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Rust can be installed <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">in</span> numerous ways, including via Brew for both Rust and <a href="http://doc.crates.io/">Cargo</a>, its build tool. But I recommend using <a href="https://rustup.rs/">Rustup</a>, <a href="https://rustup.rs/">rustup.rs</a>. Rustup lets you toggle between release and nightly version of Rust, and some frameworks require nightly builds.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><h4><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Learning Rust</span></h4><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">The main <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust website</a>, <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">rust-lang.org</a>, is a good place to start to learn about Rust. Especially the "<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/README.html">Rust book</a>", <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/README.html">https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/README.html</a>, is a great source to learn about basic Rust concepts. Further reading at <a href="http://rustbyexample.com/index.html">rustbyexample.com/index.html</a> and <a href="https://aturon.github.io/">aturon.github.io</a> was very useful. As well as various blogs on Rust such as <a href="https://hoverbear.org/2017/03/03/setting-up-a-rust-devenv/">hoverbear.org</a> and <a href="http://hermanradtke.com/tags/rustlang.html">hermanradtke.com</a>.<br /><br />Once you start coding I also recommend the standard library documentation, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/">doc.rust-lang.org/std/,</a> to find out what methods are available, e.g. does option have map, and what is getOrElse called in rust (unwrap) etc.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><h4><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Web frameworks</span></h4><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">As I most of the time create web services or full webapps an important part of my interest is which web frameworks are available. Fortunately the Rust community also recognise the importance of this, so <a href="http://www.arewewebyet.org/">www.arewewebyet.org</a> and <a href="https://github.com/flosse/rust-web-framework-comparison">github.com/flosse/rust-web-framework-comparison</a> are great information on which frameworks and libraries are available with Rust.<br /><br />This lead me to take a look at the newest kid on the block <a href="https://rocket.rs/">Rocket</a>, <a href="https://rocket.rs/">rocket.rs</a>. So far Rocket have worked very well for me. <br /><br />For my Rustic Pizza I plan to also take a look at <a href="http://ironframework.io/">Iron</a>,  <a href="http://ironframework.io/">http://ironframework.io</a>, as it is the most popular Rust web framework on github. Though it has not been updated as much lately compared to Rocket.<br /><br />Hopefully if time allows I may get to look more in depth into <a href="http://nickel.rs/">Nickel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/conduit-rust/conduit">Conduit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Ogeon/rustful">Rustful</a> as well.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><h4><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Keep rusting?</span></h4><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Whether I will keep using Rust time will tell. Core Rust concepts such as ownership, references, memory management etc are not aspects I care to manually control and think about too much as I hope a compiler and garbage collector optimises and ha<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">ndles</span> those for me. But I will keep at it so maybe Rust will accompany if not replace Scala as the main hammer in my toolbox some day.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span>
