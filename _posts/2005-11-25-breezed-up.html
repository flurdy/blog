Finally got round to upgrade to Ubuntu's latest version, Breezy Badger (5.10). 
<br />
<br />Received my CDs from ubuntu/canonical ShipIt service, so that made the upgrades easier, even though I had downloaded the Iso.
<br />
<br />First impression is not much has changed, which is good as Hoary was good before. Starting to notice nice little tweaks, like lineakd now looks integrated, sony laptop buttons works better, nicer boot up splash screen, etc.
<br />
<br />So I got no excuse not to update my postfix howto now...
