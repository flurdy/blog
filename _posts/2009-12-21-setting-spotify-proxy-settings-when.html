My problem:<br /><br />* Installed <a href="http://www.spotify.com">Spotify </a>for the first time on work machine.<br />* Work has very restrictive default proxy, which bans Spotify.<br /><br />Thankfully being a developer <span style="font-style:italic;">in IT</span> we know of a few more leniant alternative proxies....<br /><br />Further problem:<br /><br />* When launching spotify you need to log in with no option of defining the proxy to be used.<br />* And the error message just say unable to log in.<br /><br /><br />Solution:<br /><br />* Unplug the the network cable<br /><br />This prompts an error message with allow you to change the proxy settings.<br />Remember to plug in your cable again!
