Return of the lost child... <br /><br />Been an <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> devotee for several years now. But have recently returned to <a href="http://www.netbeans.org">NetBeans</a>. I was using netbeans before eclipse, but changed as eclipse offered more and faster development. (And JBuilder, Kawa, jedit in ancient time before then...)<br /><br />Been really impressed with NetBeans 6.1, it has really moved on from 4.x range I was using, and the 5.0 version I last checked out.<br /><br />First impression was how well <a href="http://maven.apache.org">maven</a> works within netbeans. In eclipse the <a href="http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/">m2eclipse</a> plugin does somehow works, but is cumbersome, and always something is a pain. In netbeans, the <a href="http://mevenide.codehaus.org/">mevenide</a> just works. Plain and simple. It just works as it should do, with full module structure, easy usage, seem fully integrated with the rest of the ide. nice.<br /><br />In general netbeans is a lot clearer and cleaner, eclipse interface is very messy and cumbersome. <br /><br />So Ill be a Sun slave for awhile now, till the next new better thing arrive...<br /><br />( looking through my blog, it is becomming more and more geeky. oh well. :) )
