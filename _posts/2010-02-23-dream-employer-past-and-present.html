With <a href="/2010/02/oracle-java-blog-netbeans.html">the demise</a> of <a href="http://www.sun.com">Sun</a> following the <a href="http://www.oracle.com">Oracle's</a> <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/sun/index.htm">acquisition</a> of it (or resurection depending on your view), I remembered that Sun Microsystem was once a "dream" employer of mine.<br /><br />With Sun always seemingly on the forefront of technology, inventing(or acquiring) and leading the development of tools I liked; mainly Java but also within Unix, OpenOffice, VirtualBox, MySQL, etc.. And being fond of Open Source they were my "dream" company in the 90ies and early years of 2000.<br /><br />But that faded over the last decade, so I began pondering what my current dream employers would be. <br /><br /><br /><h3>Current employer</h3><br />And is it wise to speak/blog about other companies than <a href="http://www.tieto.com">my current</a>?  Would my current employer be offended or even future employers if not mentioned? <br /><br />As Ive never been known to care too much about political correctness nor company politics I plow on regardless... Anyway would I still be at a company if I did not appreciate it? Maybe when I was a developer padawan I may have had less options, but today I can pick and choose so I don't think my current employer nor future ones will be that offended. :)<br /><br /><br /><h3>Dark past</h3><br />Actually when I think about it, even Microsoft was a highly thought of employer in my early years. But grew out of that! Even IBM seemed attractive to the na√Øve student.<br /><br /><br /><h3>Today's dream companies</h3><br /><br /><ol><br /> <li><b><a href="http://www.springsource.com">SpringSource</a></b><br/><br />   Avid user of their <a href="http://www.springframework.org">framework(s)</a>.<br />   Met a few of their employers whom seem great advocates for the company.<br />   But wary of VMWare influence, too corporate?<br />   (Offices in Southampton and now Frimley are close to family and potential future home in Alton, Hampshire.)<br /> </li><br /> <li><b><a href="http://www.atlassian.com">Atlassian</a></b><br/><br />  Great tools (Jira,Confluence,etc).<br />  Great supporters of Open Source projects.<br />  Influenced by their sponsering of JavaPosse.<br /> </li><br /> <li><b><a href="http://www.canonical.com">Canonical</a></b><br/><br />  The company behind Ubuntu.<br />  Nice ethos, even the Ubuntu name.  <br />  But perhaps not a Java company?<br />  And Im defintely not a C man.<br /> </li><br /> <li><b><a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a></b><br/><br />  Great tool.<br />  Still a small company.<br />  But any relevant Java?<br /> </li><br /> <li><b><a href="http://www.spotify.com">Spotify</a></b><br/><br />  Great tool. <br />  Great solution for future music.<br />  Interesting future.<br /> </li><br /> <li><b><a href="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon AWS</a></b><br/><br />  Amazon web service, mostly <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2">ec2</a>.<br />  Use it myself for my private servers, <br />  <a href="http://flurdy.com/docs/ec2/">written documentation on how to use ec2</a> for others.<br />  Would be interesting to work with their cloud.<br /> </li><br /> <li><b><a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com">Remember the milk</a></b><br/><br />  Maybe too small? <br />  But supports distributed work force.<br /> </li><br /> <li><b><a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a></b><br/><br />  Now too large. Nice ethos.<br />  Great innovators.<br />  Too algorithmic/academic culture.<br />  Bad reputation for coder burn.<br /> </li><br /></ol><br /><br /><br /><h3>Dream role/position out of scope</h3><br />Dream/fantasy company/employer does not make working for them an ideal job. The actual position I would work as is obviously the crucial part. Perhaps you can have a dream position in an awfull company and the other way round. I am sure there always some disgruntled workers working for even in general fantastic companies. <br /><br />Other factors such as job stability, salary and other compensations, location, coworkers, potential personal growth etc are all important but all out of scope for this list.<br /><br /><br /><h3>Analysis</h3><br /><br />If I review my list they tend to be smaller companies that have one or more great applications that I use myself. Perhaps they are not great companies, they just make great tools? Quite a few are also Open Source supporters.<br /><br />And they may be cool companies, but are they working with what I do? Any Java? As I move away from a fulltime developer role and more and more into a system architect role, technology should be not so relevant, but I still mostly prefer Java based solutions (Or similar, Scala, Groovy etc). Due to less need to reinvent the wheel, more mature libraries, easier employment/training of developers, and personal indepth knowledge. And I do not know if these companies use Java, or even if they do if it is a marginalised technology choice.<br /><br /><br /><h3>Summary</h3><br /><br />What is important in the end is job satisfaction and that it supports my life outside work: Family etc. A great Norwegian motto is that "you work to have spare time". Ie the reason you work is to afford having quality spare time. In addition I think it is important that you enjoy what you work with. I do, basically I get paid to do my hobby.<br /><br />If I am happy in a role the company should not matter. So this list will probably stay as a "dream" list". If I ever did work for one of them, I might actually see sides of the company that might tarnish the "dream" label! <br /><br />In a perfect world, my dream company would be a charity. But I would feel guilty about demanding a significant salary from such a company. So my requirement of quality of life for me and my family may lower my ethical requirement of a company. But <a href="http://www.fireflywiki.org/Firefly/BlueSun">Microsoft</a> is no longer on my list so I have some standards.<br /><br />Actually anything based in a nice spot (Caribean, Barcelona, Meditereanian, New York) would have a great chance of making my list!
