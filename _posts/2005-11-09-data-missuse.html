Found while <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=ivar+abrahamsen">searching google</a> on my name, that apperently I like "<a href="http://www.gamemobile.co.uk/3dgoldenwarrior.htm">3D Golden Warrior</a>"! Never heard of nor played the game, nor can I imagine that I ever will.<br /><br />I have however downloaded Sensible Soccer, so looks like they missuse their customer data. So basically dont trust gamemobile.co.uk! (Though it was themobilegamer.co.uk I used)<br /><br /><br />BELAY THAT ORDER! I have spoken to the site and it is all a simple mistake. Basically my user id was an old one and so got two accounts interlinked. Simple db error. Ive made the same mistake several times myself, when the genrator gets reset or dbs merge... So they are not so bad after all
