I have a few ringtones Ive been using for years, across many phones. And I am now very tuned into them.<br /><br />It was therefor quite annoying to find out that IPhone does not allow you to simply transfer them directly to it from my Nokia N95.<br /><br />A bit of googling I found out that Apple deliberately bars this.<br />A bit more of googling I found out how to circumvent this restrictions.<br /><br />Basically I followed this:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://johnjimmy.blogspot.com/2009/10/how-to-create-ringtones-for-iphone-m4r.html">http://johnjimmy.blogspot.com/2009/10/how-to-create-ringtones-for-iphone-m4r.html</a></li></ul><br />and this<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.labnol.org/software/make-iphone-ringtons-with-free-itunes/4738/">http://www.labnol.org/software/make-iphone-ringtons-with-free-itunes/4738/</a></li></ul><br /><br />And you do not have to jailbrake your phone, nor pay for software. The software used is simply a free well established audio sampling program.<br /><br />Here is a breakdown:<br /><ol><br /><li> Transfer ringtone to PC (a windows box this time) from old phone. By bluetooth, email, Nokia's filebrowser etc (I located them via the phones file browser and emailed them as my desktop dont have the cable nor bluetooth)<br /></li><li> Install <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/download/">Audacity</a> v 1.3+ <br /></li><li> Install <a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/index.php?title=FAQ:Installation_and_Plug-Ins#How_do_I_download_and_install_the_LAME_MP3_encoder.3F">Lame for Audacity</a><br /></li><li> Install <a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/index.php?title=FAQ:Installation_and_Plug-Ins#installffmpeg">FFMPeg for Audacity</a><br /></li><li> Launch Audacity and locate audio file<br /></li><li> (You can copy into new file, edit etc if you want, but dont overwrite your original ringtone/song)<br /></li><li> Go to File/Export<br /></li><li> Enter details if desired, and choose m4a(ffmpeg)as export file type.<br /></li><li> Exit Audacity and locate new file in windows explorer<br /></li><li> Rename extension from m4a to m4r<br /></li><li> Open ITunes, and drag file from explorer into your library<br /></li><li> Sync and voila!<br /></li><br /></ol>

Another problem I had.<br/>
I had bought a song via ITunes on my phone, but after syncing it was no longer on my phone.

Apparently drm'd songs need to be "played" on the pc's itunes before it is "autohorized" to sync it back to the
phone.....
