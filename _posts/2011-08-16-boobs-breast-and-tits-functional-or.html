A different post than my normal rambling:
<br />
<br />Our beautiful baby daughter was recently born, and is in the middle of breastfeeding. And this constant feeding got me thinking of how I was reacting to this exposure.
<br />
<br />Basically at the moment I am only thinking of my partners boobs as a utility to feed our daughter. They have purely a functional property. 
<br />
<br />It is quite the same when I see other mothers feed their babies on park benches etc. Mostly I think it is just sweet or indifferent to it.
<br />
<br />So basically this body part which often is connected with attraction and excitement, is by introducing a baby changing my perception completely. And I would guess this reaction is similar with most other males, at various degrees (and probably some exceptions).
<br />
<br />
<br />But remove the baby and any pregnancy references, if I catch a glimpse of a breast or cleavage I still snigger like a teenager...
<br />
<br />
<br />Well at least I got to have "boobs" in a blog title, instead of my normal geeky techy posts :)
