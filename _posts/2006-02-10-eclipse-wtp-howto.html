The <a target="_top" href="http://www.eclipse.org/webtools">Eclipse web tools project</a> seems to have matured enough so Ive started to switch to Eclipse from Netbeans (sort of).<br /><br />Ive always prefered <a target="_top" href="http://www.netbeans.org">Netbeans</a> as it is aimed at java web developers and works as such straight away. <a target="_top" href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> with its huge following needed too much tweaking, immature/costly plugins etc to get there so I never bothered before. With each iterative Netbeans just got better and better, version 5 is so integrated with <a target="_top" href="http://ant.apache.org">Ant</a>, <a target="_top" href="http://tomcat.apache.org">Tomcat</a>, <a target="_top" href="http://www.jboss.org">Jboss</a> et all so makes web app development so easy.<br /><br />However now that WTP has reached version 1.0 I thought I'd check it out again. And I was impressed. Ant integration is good, not quite netbeans level, but different.<br />Tomcat integration is good, and standard web tools is perhaps better than netbeans.<br />Im still not 100% happy with it though. The project structure is not as configurable, the tomcat sync does use my ant scripts to include libs and confs. But impressed.<br /><br />In the end I created a quick <a target="_top" href="http://flurdy.com/docs/eclipse/">howto on installing Eclipse WTP</a> in <a target="_top" href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a>.<br /><br />I still recommened Netbeans 5 for all web app developers, however Eclipse WTP is getting there.
