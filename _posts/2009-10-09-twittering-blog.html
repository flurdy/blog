I used to write blog entries more often, whenever I had something on my mind that I wanted to rant about. Although prevously never a frequent blogger , lately I have blogged less and less. <br /><br />Why? <a href="http://twitter.com/flurdy">Twitter</a>.<br /><br />Before I would write pages and pages of mostly repeating rants. Now I restrict it to one twitter tweet (or two). And quite frequently...<br /><br />But my long rants are now gone, or very rare. Maybe that is a good idea.<br /><br /><br /><br />So what if any are the pros and cons of this "evolution":<br /><br /><br />Pros:<br />* My blog is not filled with rants.<br />* I twitter a lot.<br />* My rants are to the point, not filled with reiterated jibberish.<br />* My grievances are shared with more people.<br /><br /><br />Cons:<br />* I twitter too much?<br />* I rant more often.<br />* My blog is never updated.<br />* My twitter rants have no detail, or reflection.<br />* The threshold to rant is lower, and often rant needlessly, before I can rethink and research my issue.<br /><br /><br />And I presume this has happened for other people as well. <br /><br />Funny, since the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Williams_(blogger)">people behind [1]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biz_Stone">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.blogger.com">blogger</a> are some of the <a href="http://twitter.com/ev">founders</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">twitter</a>. Killing their own lovechild?
