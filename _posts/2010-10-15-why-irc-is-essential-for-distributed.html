Realising more every day that IRC is essential for distributed teams.<br /><br />IMs (<a href="http://messenger.msn.com">MSN</a>,  <a href="http://talk.google.com">Google Talk</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Lync_Server">Communicator</a>, etc), <a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a> & <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/live-meeting/">Live Meeting</a> works well but is too sheltered, it is invitational only and time constrained.<br /><br />Email is recorded, too formal, noisy and too asynchronous/slow.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.yammer.com">Yammer</a> or <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> is nice for distributing comments and discussions, but is too slow for actual problem solving.<br /><br />To keep teams up to date or solve problems together; a group chat is essential. <br /><br />For culture build and low barrier of interaction of an informal and not archived discussions; a group chat is essential. <br /><br />For <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?RubberDucking">rubber duck</a> statements or help in minor but blocking issues that would be less likely to ask people directly; a group chat is helpful. <br /><br />For less direct interruptions than IMs or phone; a group chat message which people can respond to when suitable will improve productivity. <br /><br />Even for non distributed teams, IRC is an important productivity and culture tool. <a href="http://agiletracksoftware.com/blog.html?id=7">Continuous inconsiderate interruptions</a> will kill productivity, while quick but asynchronous discussions smooth over the time requirements of the person asking and the person responding.<br /><br />Unfortunately IRC is just too ugly, too much unix/hacker impression, too old; for an enterprise / self important company to consider.<br /><br />Alternatives like the now discontinued <a href="http://wave.google.com">Google Wave</a>, <a href="http://37signals.com">37signals's</a> <a href="http://campfirenow.com">CampFire</a> and others exist, but an internal IRC server does solve all these issues.
