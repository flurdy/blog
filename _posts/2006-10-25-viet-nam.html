Back from two weeks in Vietnam, cycling from Saigon to Hanoi.<br /><br />Fantastic country, brilliant people, too many motorbikes!<br /><br />In the heat the climbs were hard, but otherwise the 500 km we cycled flew by.<br /><br />In total we covered 1700 km, with some 500 by a sleep train, and the rest bussing through traffic or very hilly sections.<br /><br />There were endless picture perfect beaches that was completly empty. Wont take many years before the beach bum tourists catch up though.<br /><br />1-2-3 YO!
