I recently tried to install and run Civilization IV Beyond the Sword in Ubuntu. And it worked flawlessly!<br /><br />* <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_IV">Civilization IV</a> by <a href="http://www.firaxis.com">Firaxis</a> and its range of games has always in been a favorite of mine.<br />* <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_the_Sword">Beyond the Sword</a> is a recent extention to this game.<br />* <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> is a <a href="http://www.distrowatch.com">linux distrobution</a> that I use.<br />* For this to work I used <a href="http://www.codeweavers.com">CodeWeaver's</a> <a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/products/cxgames/">CrossOver Games</a>. CrossOver is based on <a href="http://www.winehq.org">Wine</a>, with some not-yet-in-Wine code and some proprietary code.<br />* And I installed this on <a href="http://www.dell.com">Dell</a> D820 laptop PC.<br /><br />There was nothing complicated in installing it either. And from CDs.<br /><br />* I simple installed Ubuntu 8.10 Intrepid Ibex.<br />* then installed CrossOver Games 7.1.0<br />* then inside CrossOver installed Civilization IV.<br />* then installed Beyond the sword. It automatically updated my Civ4 and installed DirectX which I presume CrossOver intercepted.<br />* then I downloaded the most recent patch of BTS. 3.17. Installed it inside CrossOver.<br />* Then ran the game.<br />* Sound did not work 1st time, but specifying ALSA as sound in CrossOver fixed it.<br /><br />Video introduction, etc everything seems to work. In fullscreen and as a windowed version.<br /><br />The only think I noticied was that city production bar did not change colour, but changing that to a number in the options solved that. There may be other missing graphics, but I have not seen any. May need to run in side by side of a windows version to notice these things. Certainly nothing game playwise is missing. However I did notice one MOD did not work.<br /><br />Civilization IV is only marked with a Bronse on CodeWeavers site, however I would say Gold, as 99.5% work.<br /><br />If you do have problems, many of the forums recommend in Civ's ini files to disable intro videos etc. I have not needed to touch those files.<br /><br />* <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=504461">Ubuntu thread on Civ4 BTS</a><br />* <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=997643">Ubuntu howto on Civ4 BTS</a><br />* <a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/compatibility/browse/name/?app_id=1728">CodeWeavers page on Civ IV compatability</a><br />* <a href="http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=8788">WineHQ page on Civ IV</a>
