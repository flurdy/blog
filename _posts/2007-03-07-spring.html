Held recently a <a href="https://svn.flurdy.com/code/java/tutorials/spring/trunk/presentation/spring.ppt">presentation</a> on Spring at <a href="http://www.tietoenator.com">TietoEnator</a> and <a href="http://www.netcom.no">NetCom</a>. It was a brief introduction to the Spring  Framework and the IOC, MVC, JDBC, Hibernate, Acegi modules.<br /><br />It was the same presentation , but the first one dragged on for 1.5 hours. At which point the audience was getting quite bored. The second wizzed past in 30 minutes. This time the audience probably did not catch a lot of what I said.<br /><br />It is definetly not easy. Both times  the projectors played up and caused a lot of grief. The first presentation included way too many examples. The second not enough.<br /><br />If curious, the presentation is <a href="https://svn.flurdy.com/code/java/tutorials/spring/trunk/presentation/spring.ppt">here</a>, and all the examples are <a href="https://svn.flurdy.com/code/java/tutorials/spring/trunk">here</a>.
