I got it from Henrik Tandberg on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=5861973&view=album&id=697625116&ref=nf">Facebook</a>.<br /><br />For this I used a photo by daliborlev: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mr_gonzales ">www.flickr.com/photos/mr_gonzales</a> and a quote by David Letterman.<br /><br /><br />For your own album follow these guidelines:<br /><br />---<br /><br />1 - Go to "wikipedia." Hit “random”<br />or click <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random</a><br />The first random wikipedia article you get is the name of your band.<br /><br />2 - Go to "Random quotations"<br />or click  <a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/random.php3">www.quotationspage.com/random.php3</a><br />The last four or five words of the very last quote of the page is the title of your first album.<br /><br />3 - Go to flickr and click on “explore the last seven days”<br />or click  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/7days">www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/7days</a><br />Third picture, no matter what it is, will be your album cover. <br /><br />4 - Use photoshop or similar to put it all together.<br /><br />5 - Post it to  <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> with this text in the "caption" and TAG the friends you want to join in. (you can untag yourself if you don't want this photo up) <br /><br /><br />---<br /><br />My, flurdy, changes to these rules are:<br /><br />---<br /><br />3 - Follow the 3rd step, but make sure the photo has a license which allow reproduction. I would suggest looking at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons">flickr.com/creativecommons</a>.<br /><br />4 - Instead of photoshop, I se <a href="http://www.picnik.com">picnik.com</a>. Its free and online, and with the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4889">firefox extension</a> links directly from flickr.<br /><br />5 - I posted mine back to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/flurdy">flickr</a> and now to <a href="http://blog.flurdy.com">my blog</a>.<br /><br />---<br /><br />The picture by daliborlev was licensed under CC-by-sa-nc, while my normal flickr work is CC-by-sa, so I had to add nc to this album photo.
