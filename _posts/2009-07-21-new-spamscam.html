Got this in the mailbox:<br />-----------------------<br />from judith <judith@eworlddnr.hk><br />sender-time Sent at 12:55 (GMT+08:00). Current time there: 3:26 AM. âœ†<br />to info <info@anyview.org><br />date Tue, Jul 21, 2009 at 12:55<br />subject About " anyview" intellectual property rights ( TO CEO & Principal )<br /> <br /> <br />Dear CEO & Principal ,<br /> <br />We are a domain name registration and dispute organization in Asia, which mainly deal with the global companies' domain name registration and internet Intellectual property right protection. Currently, we have a pretty important issue needing to confirm with your company.<br /><br />On July 20, 2009, we received an application formally. One company named " Odnny Holdings Ltd " wanted to applied for the Internet Keyword "anyview " and some domain names through our body.      <br /> <br />Now we are handling with the registration of these domain names and find that the keyword of these names is identical with your company's. So we have to confirm with you at two points:<br />1. If your company consign Odnny company to register these names, we will send application form to them and help them finish the registration at once.<br />2. If your company have nothing to do with Odnny company, they maybe have other purposes to register these names.<br /> <br />We haven't finished the registration of Odnny company yet, and we have postponed this application of this company temporarily already. In order to deal with this issue better, please contact us by telephone or email as soon as possible.<br /><br />Waiting for your reply ASAP. <br /><br />Judith<br />Auditing Department<br />________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /> <br />Tel: +852-2297-9279       <br />Fax: +852-2297-9209<br />Email:judith@eworlddnr.hk<br />Email:judith@eworld.hk<br />Website: http://www.eworlddnr.hk<br />judith<br />2009-07-21<br /><br />-----------------------<br /><br /><br />Though about it for a second, seemed a quite odd,<br />then a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=eworlddnr.hk">quick google</a> to confirm it is a scam. <br /><br />If you receive something similar, ignore it. Or more fun string them along, but be careful.
