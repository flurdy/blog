New Job, new house(soon), new country(well return to old)!<br /><br />We have moved back to Norway, Oslo to be precise. Its a great summer, not looking forward to the autumn, but winter will be great again. <br /><br />Flatsearching is a battle, as each one gets snapped immidietly as they come up for sale. <br /><br />New job is good, Im now a senior consultant. More mature role, so no sleep-ins anymore.<br /><br />But its all good.
