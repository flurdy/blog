Started the 4th edition of my howto on setting up a postfix mail server in linux.<br /><br />Ubuntu, the distro it is based upon has released a new version, so the howto needs updating. Also integrating postgrey, an excellent spam reduction method. And try to include some fixes and tweaks from last time.<br /><br />Also started to encourage people to use the ubuntu forums, instead of contacting me regarding the howto, as I have weeks of unreplied messages to look at....<br /><br />Found <a href="http://www.lambie.org/wordpress/index.php/category/interesting-websites/page/2/">this page</a> on lambie.org, nice to get praised some times!
