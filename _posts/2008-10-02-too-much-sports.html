I do too much sport. <br /><br />Not that looking at me that would be your first impression, :) but sometimes I think I do.<br /><br />Clarification: I don't play sports 24/7 anymore. But I am interested in and pursue too many sports. And no, not just as a spectator, but active participant.<br /><br />As a kid I would play all sports all the time. I would play football (soccer) once or twice a day, I would play ice-hockey all winter, I would ski, swim, etc at any oppertunity etc. <br /><br />This continued with a lot of football and hockey throughout  <a href="http://www.manchester.ac.uk">university</a>. Large quanteties of beer and kebabs at university, followed afterwards with no time due to work, technology and girlfriend meant my physical shape no longer reflected a sporting interest...<br /><br /><br />But my moan today is that I still do too many different sports, and I enjoy them all, and I do none often enough to get good at any of them. Im not bad at any sport, but not great at most.<br /><br />Once a week, which in reality works out to twice a month, I still play football, mostly 3-a-side indoors, and now also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floorball">floorball</a> (innebandy). <br /><br />Before I changed contract to down the road I used to cycle to work. Now it is only the occational trip at weekends.<br /><br />Squash, played twice this month. Before that it was two years.<br /><br />Tennis, got the gear, used to play a few times a year. Last time: two years ago.<br /><br />Ice hockey - go skating a few times a year, no-one to play with anymore....<br /><br />Rollerblades - Go 5-10 times in the summer, which are brief in Norway.<br /><br />Kayak - did beginners course last month. Loved it. Cant imagine Id go more than once or twice a year.<br /><br />Sailing - still waiting to get round to do my beginners course.<br /><br />Climbing - ditto<br /><br />Downhill skiing - More now I live back in Norway. About 4-5 times during winter.<br /><br />Crosscountry skiing - An option again now Im in Oslo. 3-4 times a year.<br /><br />Jogging/running - finally a sport I don't enjoy. but get dragged along. about once a week at the moment, hoping to cut down to once a month.<br /><br />Gym - stopped paying membership when I moved. <br /><br />Keen on any other sports as they come along: badminton, basketball, (beach) volleyball, surfing, snowboard, you name it.<br /><br />So in the end its all different sports every time, and a long time between each time I do the same sport, so I don't think Ill make the olympics. :)
