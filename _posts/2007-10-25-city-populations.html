Must have been bored today. <br />Started looking at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Europe">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Europe</a> then got to....<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Different ways of counting city population....:</span><br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_urban_areas_of_the_European_Union"><br />Largest_urban_areas_of_the_European_Union</a>: Manchester is 7th largest area with 3.8 mill people.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_European_metropolitan_areas">Largest_European_metropolitan_areas</a>:  Manchester is 11th with 4.2 mill people. However in the Manchester City itself is only 440,000 (but that does not include Salford, Oldham, Trafford, Sale, etc).<br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larger_Urban_Zones_%28LUZ%29_in_the_European_Union">Larger_Urban_Zones_(LUZ)_in_the_European_Union</a>: Manchester is 14th with 2.8 mill people. The scousers keep interfering in the others, but this is perhaps the proper size of Manchester.<br /><br /><br />Ps. Looking at it differently<br /><br /><a href="http://www.top500.de/cities/ranks/page000.php">www.top500.de/cities/ranks/page000.php</a>: Oslo is Europe's fifth largest city!
