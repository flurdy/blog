Attended a estimation seminar yesterday morning. Some fluff, but being exposed to the theories and practicalities of <a href="http://www.planningpoker.com/">Planning Poker</a> was worth the time.<br /><br />Used it immitietly in the afternoon for a project that we were still struggling to define the tasks needed. Very effective, in just getting a discussion going, grouping tasks and assigning estimation units to each task/story.<br /><br />Well worth a try, even if it made us look like we were playing poker all afternoon, especially as we sat in a tiny glass cubicle at a client.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/book/view/1">Agile estimation book by Mike Cohn</a>
