<a target="_top" href="http://last.fm">Last.fm</a> is a great idea. Uninterputed real music. No babble, no ads, just good music.<br /><br />And it gets better and better as you tell it what you like.<br /><br />Not sure if the bandwidth would cope if everyone at work joined as well. But 16kb/s is not too bad.
