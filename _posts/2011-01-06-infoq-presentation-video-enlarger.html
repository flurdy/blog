I like <a href="http://www.infoq.com">Infoq</a>, and especially their presentations.<br /><br />These presentation page has 3 elements: <br /><ul><br /><li>Top left: One small video showing the person presenting</li><br /><li>Top right: One  small window describing the presentation and presenters</li><br /><li>Bottom: One large window showing the actual presentation slide</li><br /></ul><br /><br />This layout works very well, and basically shows you what you need.<br /><br />But...<br /><br />The window is a bit small (320x240), especially on larger resolutions screens. Especially when the presenter also shows some code, which is usually shown in the video window.<br /><br />So I wrote a little <a href="http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/user-scripts">user script</a> which enlarges this video window (480x320).<br />This script is only for the <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome browser</a>. A similar <a href="http://www.mozilla.com">Firefox</a> based <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748/">GreaseMonkey script</a> should be easy to convert.<br /><br /><hr/><br /><br />To install click on my<br/> <a href="http://www.ivar.co.uk/cargo/infoq-enlarge-presentation.chrome.user.js">InfoQ Presentation Video Enlarger user script</a> available at <br/><a href="http://www.ivar.co.uk/cargo/infoq-enlarge-presentation.chrome.user.js">www.ivar.co.uk/cargo/infoq-enlarge-presentation.chrome.user.js</a>.<br /><br /><hr/><br /><br />You can download and look at the js in a text editor first.It really is a very small and easy to understand script.<br /><br />Anyone can contribute changes if desired.
