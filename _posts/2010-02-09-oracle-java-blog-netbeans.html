So Oracle has now <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/sun/index.htm">finally gotten</a> their <a href="http://www.sun.com">Sun</a>.  What does this mean for me and the javasphere? <br /><br />A lot of people have strong feelings about the aqcuisition/merger and some feel strongly against Oracle. I don't. I don't love Oracle, but I think Java will be fine, if not better with their stewardship.<br /><br /><h4>Java</h4><br /><br />Oracle needs Java, they use it all over their own product line and obviously especially with their <a href="http://www.oracle.com/bea/index.html">former Bea products</a> Java is core to their business. So an evolving, healthy and competitive Java is in their interest. <br /><br />So Java, JEE, the Java VM platform etc will be fine, with more money available than at Sun. Actually it may be better as Oracle has a lot more funding and marketing capability, and it may revive the ailing JCP?<br /><br /><br />But what about the other Sun products, and specifically those related to Java?<br /><br /><br /><h4>Glassfish</h4><br />I don't use glassfish, at least not directly, so personally I have no strong feelings on how Oracle will proceede with Glassfish compared to its more corporate Weblogic.<br /><br />I use <a href="http://www.oracle.com/appserver/weblogic/weblogic-suite.html">Weblogic</a> at work and either <a href="http://jetty.codehaus.org/jetty/">Jetty</a> or <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</a> on <a href="http://code.flurdy.com">pet projects</a> at home.<br /><br /><br /><h4>Kenai</h4><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Kena">Kenai</a> was to be killed, but read somewhere today it may be saved.<br />I don't use it. I have a few projects on <a href="http://sf.net">Sourceforge</a>, and future ones may be on SF or perhaps <a href="http://code.google.com">google code</a> or <a href="http://github.org">Github</a>.<br /><br /><br /><h4>Netbeans</h4><br /><a href="http://www.netbeans.org">Netbeans</a> however I do use. <br /><br />In the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/community/sun-oracle-community-continuity.html">initial press release</a> by Oracle on its plans for Sun's product line they stated it was to be focused as a scripting IDE and leave JEE, java enterprise level, to their own JDeveloper and <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> tools.<br /><br />I use it with Maven and JEE modules so this feature strategy change would affect me very much. I dabled with eclipse for a few years, and still use when forced to at work, but prefer Netbean's cleaner interface (Its not made by IBM...)<br /><br />However again in an <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/java/htdocs/javatoolsfaq.html">updated press release</a> they have a seperate java tooling page regarding their plans and they may not restrict it to that. Lets hope not.<br /><br /><br /><h4>Cloud</h4><br />Oracle killed Sun's cloud computing ambitions. Fine by me. They are not into being a hosting provider.<br /><br /><a href="http://flurdy.com/docs/ec2/">I use</a> <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2">Amazon's ec2</a> a lot, and will not miss it. However I did not know enough about its features compared to ec2 and <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google's App engine</a>. It would have to be much better than those to have been worth it. Maybe it was more like <a href="http://ubuntu.com/cloud">Ubuntu's cloud offering</a> with hardware hosting?<br /><br /><br /><h4>VirtualBox</h4><br />VirtualBox I do use, and glad it looks like it will be kept as is, I think.<br /><br /><br /><h4>Solaris</h4><br />I have no strong feelings for or against Solaris, but keeping it competitive is probably in their interest.<br /><br />The hardware and other areas I am not too bothered about. I used Sparc at university, but not since.<br /><br />Other links:<br />http://blogs.oracle.com/devtools/2010/02/updated_faq_for_the_developer.html<br />http://www.oracle.com/ocom/groups/public/documents/webcontent/038563.pdf
