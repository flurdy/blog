My server keeps crashing. No idea why. And I cant physically get to it anymore. It feels really frustrating.... :(<br /><br />It has been up faultlessly for more than two years so suppose ive been spoilt. <br /><br />And the other people I share the server can neither get to the server easily, but at least they still work in the same country as the ISP. But it means days delay between reboots. And then some hours of searching for why it crashes before its gone again.<br /><br />Things is, it worked faultlessly when we removed it from the isp and ran it for a few days at someones house. But in the ISP it dies within a day.<br /><br />If it is hardware, my main suspect is always the powersupply. But I cant remember what the specs where......
