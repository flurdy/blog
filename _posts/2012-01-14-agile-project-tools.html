Been briefly assessing some online free tools for agile task planning for a few personal FOSS projects.<br /><br />A physical task board is perhaps the suggestion from the agile purists, however not useful for me (nor my family :)).<br /><br />At work I often have to use the awful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_Quality_Center">Quality Center</a>. It is good for planning functional testing, but not much else. The user interface is painful, and only works on windows with IE. <br /><br />But most project I have been on eventually drop it for the more developer friendly <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/overview">Jira</a> by <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a>. Its UI gets cleaner and cleaner. And is great for Scrum projects since the intergration of <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/greenhopper/overview">GreenHopper</a>. It is however very feature rich which is good and bad, and sometimes quite slow. I recommend Jira for distributed larger organisations. It is however an overkill for my needs.<br /><br />I have been using <a href="http://www.pivotaltracker.com/">Pivotal Tracker</a> for some of my projects for a few years. It is a great tool. For scrum projects it is the tool I would recommend the most. They recently started charging but it is still free for public projects. It is however very iteration/scrum centric and as such not useful for my more Kanbanish time irrelevant requirements.<br /><br />So I started to look at more tools (and revisit some previous ones). <br />My requirements are:<br /><ol><br /><li>Free, as in beer or near enough. $9/month and similar is too much for personal projects unless heavily used.</li><br /><li>Agile task board simulation</li><br /><li>Not time iteration based</li><br /><li>Simple functional UI, but not ugly</li><br /><li>Icebox feature for storing tasks/ideas not yet ready for the backlog</li><br /><li>Pivotal like Feature, Chore and Bug classification</li><br /><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)#2._Limit_WIP">Limiting WIP</a></li><br /><li>Kanban queues</li><br /><li>Simple T-shirt or fibonacci estimates</li></ol><br />Not all requirements have to be met.<br /><br />Here are my initial impressions:<br /><br /><h5><a href="http://www.pivotaltracker.com/">Pivotal Tracker</a></h5><br />Time iterative centric.<br />Looks nice. Clean interface. <br />No WIP limit.<br />No kanban queue.<br />Got Icebox feature<br />Got Feature-chore-bug classification.<br />Fibonacci estimates.<br />Unlimited free public projects.<br /><br /><h5><a href="http://agilezen.com/">AgileZen</a></h5><br />Kanban style flow.<br />Looks nice. Clean interface. <br />Columns can be renamed.<br />Got WIP limit.<br />No icebox. Can rename backlog icebox and rename another column backlog.<br />No estimates<br />Only 1 project on the free price plan.<br />FOSS projects can apply for free usage.<br /><br /><h5><a href="http://www.kanbanery.com/">Kanbanery</a></h5><br />Kanban style flow.<br />Looks nice. Clean interface. <br />Columns can be renamed.<br />Got WIP limit.<br />Got Icebox feature<br />Got Feature-chore-bug classification.<br />T-shirt estimates.<br />Only 1 project on the free price plan.<br />No FOSS free plan.<br /><br /><h5><a href="http://www.kanbanpad.com/">Kanbanpad</a></h5><br />Kanban style flow.<br />Clean interface. <br />Little confusing UI.<br />Got Kanban queues.<br />Got WIP limit.<br />Got Icebox (the "backlog").<br />No estimates.<br />Unlimited projects.<br />All plans are free.<br />Permissions are strange. No member can edit and public can only view. Either member view and edit with no public access, or public(anonymous) can view and edit!!<br /><br /><h5><a href="http://www.leankitkanban.com/">Leankit</a></h5><br />Kanban style flow.<br />Seems very feature rich. Perhaps too many features.<br />UI a little cluttered.<br />Tasks seems too much like post-it notes.<br />Only 1 project on the free price plan.<br />No FOSS free plan.<br /><br /><br /><h5><a href="http://www.scrumdo.com/">ScrumDO</a></h5><br />Scrum focused.<br />Looks nice.<br />Feature rich. <br />UI a little confusing.<br />No Icebox.<br />No WIP limit.<br />No kanban queue.<br />Fibonacci and t-shirt estimates.<br />10 project on the free price plan.<br />No FOSS free plan.<br /><br /><h5><a href="http://flow.io/">Flow</a></h5><br />Kanban style flow.<br />Tasks seems too much like post-it notes.<br />No Icebox.<br />Got WIP limit.<br />Only 1 project on the free price plan.<br />FOSS projects can apply for free usage.<br /><br /><br />I may update this in the future when I get more impressions of the ones I use and if I find other tools.<br /><br /><br />My recommendations depends, but currently they are:<br /><ul><br /><li>For large commercial projects <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/overview">Jira</a> offer features and reports. And can be installed inside your firewall.</li><br /><li>For Scrum projects <a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.pivotaltracker.com">Pivotal Tracker</a> offers the most complete package.</li><br /><li>For Kanban projects, the it depends on your own requirements and taste, but my current favourites are <a href="http://www.blogger.com/http.//kanbanery.com">Kanbanery</a> and <a href="http://agilezen.com/">AgileZen</a>. <a href="http://www.kanbanpad.com/">Kanbanpad</a>'s no restrictions on number of projects is also tempting</li></ul>
