Following on from <a href="/2009/01/dont-like-scrum-but-will-not-use.html">my general rant about Scrum, Part 1</a>, here is Part 2.<br /><br /><br />The main beef I have about Scrum, are <br />* the constant status updates at stand up meetings<br />* the use of non electronic tools <br />* inflexibility on tasks<br /><br />These are elements that are easily changed and is probably mostly interpretation. My dislike for these can also reflect perhaps badly on me, if taken from a superficial view.<br /><br />I don't like the morning stand ups. For several selfish reasons.<br />* I don't like mornings. <br />* I am not in early. (Especially now living in Norway where developers start work 4 hours earlier than in the UK even with only 1 hour time zone difference. My last job in Manchester, developers where not in till 11am. Here they start at 7am... )<br />* I don't like standing up. <br />* My memory is terrible.<br />* My plan for the day have not yet been thought of.<br />* I don't like standing up. <br />* I prefer to work from home in the morning, thus actually getting something done, instead of being a zombie at a meeting.<br />* I don't like mornings. <br />* I don't like the micro-management of it.<br />* It is a forced meeting.<br />* I don't like standing up. <br /><br /><br />It is not that I don't agree with status meetings and I can see standing up keeps meeting briefer. <br /><br />Many of my work places, many of the companies' main issues have been solved in frequent 5min fag breaks (the English sigarette meaning of the word) even when no-ones smokes at the place. As a non-smoker I would always attend them, and discuss a bit rubberducking about things Im working on and stuck on. So informal meetings are very usefull. <br /><br />Regarding standing versus sitting, I just hate standing. And not able to fully listen to anyone else's issues.<br /><br />That it is just a quick run around of what you did yesterday, what you are going to do today and if any impediements, I just don't see the value for the developer. This should be clear in JIRA or any similar tool. Sure, it is a face-to-face status update for the management, so they can micro-manage everyone's day, but really mature developers should be trusted to deliver. That you can not discuss issues, devalues any development benefit from the meeting. <br /><br />There are also some cultural issues to consider. Standing is meant to make it quicker, but Norwegians once a meeting is finished its timeslot will stand up and leave the room even if nothing has been resolved, or even when senior management or customers are present. <br /><br /><br />As a technologist and computer geek, the use in Scrum of non-technology such as post-it notes, sticking notes on boards, face-to-face meetings, is a sore point. Again I see the value, but it just goes against the grain of a technologiest.<br /><br /><br />Also the focussing on only the tasks on the board, post-its on your desks, and status updates on these every dawn is quite blinkered. True, it will keep people in check and some is usefull to make people consentrate on the tasks delegated. <br />But also have negative effects. Such as me, whom may help too many people, which is discouraged in Scrum as you should only focus on your own task.<br /><br /><br />And don't get me started on pair programming! That I should share my days with some other smelly developers odour is quite repugant. But again I see the value of writing code, solving problems together, sharing application knowledge. I just prefer frequent fag breaks and my private space! :)<br /><br /><br />BUT let me reiterate, I would only use Scrum!

            many of the points are still valid.
