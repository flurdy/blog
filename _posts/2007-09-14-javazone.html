Another <a href="http://www.javazone.no">JavaZone</a> finished. Two full days of geektime, but fun. Stressfull, as there were too many simultaneous presentations. But it is well planned, with a lot of renowned presentors.<br /><br />Best presentations was:<br /><br />* Tijs Rademakers and Jos Dirksen showing how to use Mule in a easy to follow style.<br /><br />* James Coplien debunking some agile myths.<br /><br />* Matt Raible comparing web frameworks.<br /><br /><br /><br />My hands have been itching for a chance to test some the new tech and methods. A vaccine jab at the doctor today killed all that though!<br /><br />ClubZone, the evening entertainment, while looked good on paper and probably a lot of effort to plan, was a disaster. The problem was the Norway-Greece footy match. Fitting 2500 people (okay probably some were not into football ) into the only place that showed the match was never going to work. So my group all went home to catch the second half. No free beer for us.<br /><br />Now how can I introduce <a href="http://mule.codehaus.org">Mule</a> into our stack, without a special need for it....
