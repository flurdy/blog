Been mostly offline all summer. Well it is summer after all, but also because of moving house, jobs and country.<br /><br />Not being in your own house for several months, do make you feel a bit cut off, especially when where you stay dont have broadband. <br /><br />And when you cant enjoy the sun and sea because of 100 of property viewings, its even worse. <br /><br />My new job starts soon, so no time to do anything then. But im looking forward to it, and at least I'll be online again.
