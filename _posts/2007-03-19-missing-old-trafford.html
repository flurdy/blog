<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="{{ "/img/posts/2007/03/normal_119_1918.large.JPG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand; width: 160px;" src="{{ "/img/posts/2007/03/normal_119_1918.JPG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5043660347848259810" /></a><br /><br />Moved away from Manchester last summer, and have not been at Old Trafford at all this season. And Im starting to really miss it.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="{{ "/img/posts/2007/03/normal_110-1084_IMG.large.JPG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}"><img style="float: left; margin:0 10px 10px 0pt;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand; width: 160px;" src="{{ "/img/posts/2007/03/normal_110-1084_IMG.JPG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" border="0" alt="beckham" title="Beckham in brown coat" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5043660266243881154" /></a><br /><br />Having attended 100+ matches over the last 15 years, being at OT was a normal part of my life. Week in week out, with 60,000+ others, cheering on United, shouting abuse at scouse, city, cockney opposition and when we got good tickets, which was quite often, this was all within a few yards of the players.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="{{ "/img/posts/2007/03/normal_117_1742.large.JPG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}"><img style="float:right; margin:0 10px 10px 0px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand; width: 160px;" src="{{ "/img/posts/2007/03/normal_117_1742.JPG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" border="0" alt="floodlights" title="Flood lights" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5043660343553292498" /></a><br /><br />Now watching on TV, is okay. But as the season is hotting up it feels so remote. Not going to loose my voice watching it on TV, last time I did that was after the CL final in 99.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="{{ "/img/posts/2007/03/normal_110-1057_IMG.large.JPG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 160px;" src="{{ "/img/posts/2007/03/normal_110-1057_IMG.JPG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" border="0" alt="" alt="Solskjaer" title="chloe and solskjaer" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5043659780912576690" /></a><br /><br />Over here they use long weekends to go over for a game, spend loads of money on flights and hotels and get crap seats. While before Id get a pair of 5th row tickets for Â£26 each, have quick pint in the Quadrant before kick off, and afterwards be home in half an hour.<br /><br />Oh well, suppose its not much else I do miss from Manchester, (perhaps Didsbury pubs), and I can use my weekends to get into skiing and sailing again....
