Finally made some progress with my much delayed wishlist project.  Convinced a previous owner of wishlist.sf.net to hand the project over as he was not pursuing it.<br /><br />I have started to set up the file structure, and will soon start to plan the logic and objects needed.<br /><br />Will then advertise for help with the development. Later on, the project will definetly need some designer help, otherwise if it is too ugly; no-one will use it.<br /><br />Have a look and see what you think : <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wishlist">sf.net/projects/wishlist</a>
