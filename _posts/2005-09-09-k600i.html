Love my new phone, the sony ericsson k600i. Camera is a beauty, not 2MP of the 750 and 800s, but 1.3 which is nearly as good. Crisp and clear. My old Treo 600 camera is ancient compared to it.<br /><br />Just come back from holiday in Ibiza and used the camera on my phone more than my 5MP pentax proper camera.<br /><br />Thank god I only know a few other people with 3G phones otherwise I'd waste too much money on video calls!<br /><br />Only downside is that it does not have a full qwerty keyboard ala the Treo. But it cant have everything.
