Ok. so Ive joined facebook a few months ago, and it now seems most of the people I know are members. Suppose the media attention of how dangerous it is, attracts more...<br /><br />Can be a bit adictive at the start, and really nice to see what happened to old friends. But novelity will probably go down after a while. However if my core friends are on by then it is a nice tool to stay in touch and plan stuff.
