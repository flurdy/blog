Started reading through <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/groovy-for-domain-specific-languages-dsl/book">Groovy for Domain Specific Languages</a>, a new book by Fergal Dearle. As I interested in how to apply <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org">Groovy</a> in more enterprise applications I would have normally liked to read this book, however I was also asked to write a review of the book, so Id better read it! How to keep DSLs easy to read while easy to create and maintain with Groovy will be something I hope this book covers.<br /><br />The book was also <a href="http://books.slashdot.org/story/10/07/08/152236/Groovy-For-Domain-Specific-Languages?art_pos=3">reviewed on slashdot</a> recently.<br /><br />You can read the <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/6903-chapter-7-building-a-builder.pdf">free chapter</a> or buy the book yourself at e.g. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/184719690X?ie=UTF8&tag=ivarssite-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=184719690X">amazon.co.uk</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/184719690X?ie=UTF8&tag=flurdy-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=184719690X">amazon.com</a> or <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/groovy-for-domain-specific-languages-dsl/book">Packt</a>.<br /><br />Any comments of others interested in Groovy, especially in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">DSL</a> area are very welcome?
