Ive set up a shop for t-shirts, shirts and jumpers. Its at <a href="http://flurdy.spreadshirt.net">flurdy.spreadshirt.net</a>.<br /><br />Most likely myself, friends and family will be the most interested, but the general public may find them funny, so help yourselves!?<br /><br />There are some longsleeved shirts and hoodies, some tops for woman, but mostly t-shirts. Most are branded with <a href="http://flurdy.com">flurdy</a> logos. Prices are in british GBP at the moment.<br /><br />These are generally shirts I would buy myself, maybe other share my taste... Here is one of my t-shirts: <br /><a class="boxl" href="#" onClick="window.open('http://flurdy.spreadshirt.net','shopfenster','scrollbars=yes,width=650,height=450')"><img src="http://cache.spreadshirt.net/users/1617000/1616518/products/722/1616518_8601722_1_big.jpg" width="190" height="190" border="0" alt="test" title="8601722-7433980" /></a>
