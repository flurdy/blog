I have a habit that I wonder if others do as well. And I wonder if it is productive or counter intuitive.<br /><br />What I do is multi-book-reading. By that I mean I read several books at once.<br /><br />How I do this is by having different books in different locations. And also several books in the same location. I have a preference for printed books. PDFs of books are handy occasionally for specific searches, but I really cannot read page upon page on a screen. Kindle may be nice, but I have not yet jumped on that bandwagon.<br /><br />This multi-book effect is partially due to laziness, as when I am in the lounge I do not want to have to walk back upstairs to my study if I get a sudden urge to read or fetch a book. So I always have a half read book in the lounge. (Currently in the lounge I am re-reading the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0984521402/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=flurdy-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0984521402">Kanban book by Anderson</a>).<br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vQ-fgpW5Bg8/TyvENF-q_5I/AAAAAAAAoU4/XcZDx6Sd2QQ/s1600/bookshelf.JPG"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 214px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vQ-fgpW5Bg8/TyvENF-q_5I/AAAAAAAAoU4/XcZDx6Sd2QQ/s320/bookshelf.JPG" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5704869082217250706" /></a><br />In my study I naturally have bookshelves loaded with computers books, especially java, and always a couple on my desk. I tend not to read too long in this room (then why is it called a study?), but a quick few paragraph while the pc is rebooting etc a few times a day. The reference books however might be referred to when needed. (Current study books are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/193435659X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=flurdy-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=193435659X">Seven Languages in Seven Weeks by Tate</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321601912/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=flurdy-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321601912">Continuous Delivery by Humble &amp; Farley</a>)<br /><br />On my bed side table there may be a fiction book. I don't really want to think too much when trying to sleep.<br /><br />At work I would also have a mini library as I also tend to evangelise and lend books to colleagues. So I usually have a half read book or two or three there as well. Again for quick glances while rebooting etc, but also for longer reads during lunch if I go by myself. (Just finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307463745/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=flurdy-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307463745">ReWork by Fried &amp; Heinemeier Hansson</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591843162/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=flurdy-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=159184316">Linchpin by Godin</a>)<br /><br />When I am out-and-about e.g. queuing for the till in a shop, waiting for the bus or at lunch when I forgot a book, I use the  <a href="http://www.aldiko.com/">Aldiko</a> e-book reader on my Android phone. Being a sucker for offers at <a href="http://oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a> for epub formatted books I have quite a few on my phone. Aldiko is excellent, but the small phone format is in essence rubbish for reading books over time. It is good for quick 1-5 minutes reads but no longer. And useless for reference books as the overview of the page is difficult. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596809484/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=flurdy-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596809484">97 Things Every Programmer Should Know by Henney</a> is good for 5 minute reads)<br /><br />For longer commutes by train or plane I tend to bring an actual book. If I do this regularly I should probably invest in a Kindle. (Read bits of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1617290084/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=flurdy-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1617290084">Specification by Example by Adzic</a> on the plane recently)<br /><br />I tend do a lot of quick reads. As a stop gap filler between other events. Maybe work interrupts, maybe it is some element of ADHD, or probably our 6 months old daughter. This means I constantly waste time remembering the context of where I am in the book. <br /><br />Longer reading periods is usually a holiday pattern. This would then often involve more fiction books. I read the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316021806/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=flurdy-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0316021806">Night's Dawn trilogy</a><sup><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316021814/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=flurdy-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0316021814">[2]</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316021822/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=flurdy-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0316021822">[3]</a></sup> over the last few holidays.<br /><br />Some books I might skim read chapters to get a gist of but I know I can revisit them if I need to know those sections in detail in the future. Some books I never finish. I would say a good third or more in library I have not finished or barely read. Some turned out just not interesting, some are just skim read while others are consequences of multi-book-reading and lower down the reading priority list.<br /><br />So this multi-book-reading means I do read a lot of books. But it also means I do not finish enough books. Not very "kanban" or "one-piece-flow" :)<br /><br /><br/><br/>
